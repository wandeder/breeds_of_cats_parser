# Cat Breeds Console App (Go)

## Description
This Go console application fetches a list of cat breeds from the Cat Fact API (https://catfact.ninja/breeds), organizes them based on their country of origin, sorts the breed names by length, and finally, saves the resulting data in a JSON file named out.json. The code emphasizes code quality and error handling.
